Web vulnerabilities are a common entrypoint for attackers, in this post we will look at **SQL-Injection** and **OWASP** two of the OWASP top 10.

##SQL Injection
This occurs when unsanitized input is used in database queries

##XSS
Cross-Site Scripting allows attackers to inject scripts into web pages viewed by others.
